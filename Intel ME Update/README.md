# Intel Management Engine (ME) Update

The latest ME driver can be found in in [Fernando's Win-RAID Forum](https://www.win-raid.com/t596f39-Intel-Management-Engine-Drivers-Firmware-amp-System-Tools.html). Updating ME helps in malicious attack prevention that occured lately. The ME firmware version in this folder is Intel CSME 11.8 Consumer PCH-LP Firmware v11.8.81.3781 and the version of Intel (CS)ME System Tools is Intel CSME System Tools v11 r14 - (2018-08-09).

**Disclaimer** - Since the operations are related to BIOS, there's possibility that if some errors occur during the update process, the whole system may be unable to boot. I do not get any responsibility for bricked and broken devices.

To update to the latest ME please update to the latest available BIOS from the BIOS folder of this repo.
